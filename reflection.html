    <p style = "position:relative; left:80px; top:2px; position:relative; left:30px; top:100px; background-color:rgb(242, 246, 248);">Responsive design is a Graphic user interface (GUI) design approach used to adjust the content to the size of the various screens. 
        So, that they can adopt the size of the browser space to guarantee stability with various devices. 
        It uses various techniques to adapt the web-page layout to the viewing environment. </p>
    <p style = "position:relative; left:80px; top:2px;  position:relative; left:30px; top:110px; background-color:rgb(242, 246, 248);">Responsive web design is becoming more important nowadays as majority of mobile users visit web site more frequently. Responsive web design works through Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), by using various settings to serve different style properties depending on some characteristics of the current device in use. It is highly in use as it is making the life of business owners, and advertisers easier as it is making it possible to access any website on any device.</p>
    <p style = "position:relative; left:80px; top:2px;  position:relative; left:30px; top:120px; background-color:rgb(242, 246, 248);">Responsive web design uses breakpoints to determine the layout of the web site. These breakpoints are based on the width of the browser. In responsive design, the elements of the page reshuffle as the viewpoint change. </p>
    <p style = "position:relative; left:80px; top:2px;  position:relative; left:30px; top:135px; background-color:rgb(242, 246, 248);">I learned that building web apps by using the concept of responsive design is relative easer as we need not to make different web apps for different devices, as responsive design make it sure that the web apps work across all devices by changing the layout corresponding to the device used.</p>
    <p style = "position:relative; left:80px; top:2px;  position:relative; left:30px; top:145px; background-color:rgb(242, 246, 248);">In this course I learned a lot of unfamiliar concepts. I learned HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the inter-relation between them. By completing all the assignment, I have deep knowledge of each of them. I also done lot of practice on each concept that was explained in the class. HTML language was very easy to learn and use. It is supported by all browsers. It is very simple to edit. By manipulating the code various time, I examined the code from various angles, that made the concepts clearer. As per the course, we were first taught HTML, because after HTML it is easy to learn other languages as it is the basic of all Programming languages. The CSS language is mainly used in this course for setting the formats and layouts for HTML pages. It was also very easy to learn. It includes so many interesting concepts like setting the alignment of the page, background color, border etc. By learning CSS, it made simple to include one CSS file in various HTML files, rather than coding the format of the page repeatedly, by this it is ensuring greater consistency in designs. JavaScript was also very interesting to learn and understand. It is one of the speedy languages as it can be run immediately within the client-side browser. It provides us the ability to create rich interfaces. It is very popular because of its simplicity, as it is very simple to learn and implement as compared to other languages. I also learned about how we can link all these languages to each other. As in the final assessment too, I did link CSS, HTML AND JavaScript files to each other. I really enjoyed learning this course as it was like a game, by creating new website and testing the designs and new concepts.
